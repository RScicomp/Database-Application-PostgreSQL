CROSS THINGS OUT IF THEY”RE DONE / RESOLVED
COMMENT / ADD
— this so we can see where we are in regards to finishing the project

NOTES:
1. we are passing in a Prepared statement to most functions -- functions need to be updated
2. validation for updating personal settings needs to be done
3. customer UI is done
4. change statements to prepared statements?
5. PreparedStatment p_stm in main needs to be initialized --> p_stm = con.prepareStatement("") or would it be better not pass a prepared statement? 
6. Do we close the prepared statement in each function?
7. @Richard Gao -- you do executeStatement and set it equal to an int... should you check the value of the int afterwards?
 
8. USE branchstats !!

WHAT NEEDS TO GET DONE:
2. Q2 validation and update  
3. Q2 verifying everything works 
4. Q2 script
5. Q3 indices and reasoning why they are relevant for our application
6. Q4 tables
	- Richard (R)
	- Leila (Tableau)

	—- SQL , Picture of image, Excel / Google spreadsheet of work
	— tableau: talked to the prof and he said just write a description

8. NEED
